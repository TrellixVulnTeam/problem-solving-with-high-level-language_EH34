# Navigation
### README
Every project has its own *README.md* file. 

### Projects
There are 5 main projects as you see above. I have developed most of my code using PyCharm, that's why you see a 
.idea folder above (which you can ignore).

There is a *Project summary* section in the beginning of each README.md file, which gives a short description of the 
project. Please check out the pdf file, inside assignment folder of each project, to see more information about the 
problems that each project solve and some additional details.

### Tasks
There is a folder called *assignment* inside every project. There is a pdf inside that folder named assignment, which
contains the tasks that were given to students to solve. Some assignment folders may contain additional files. 
All files inside assignment folder were given to students by course instructors.
